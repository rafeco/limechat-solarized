Solarized Color Schemes for LimeChat
====================================

## ⚠️ Project Archived

This project is now archived. LimeChat hasn't been updated since 2020 and is no longer actively maintained. It was fun while it lasted, and these themes served the IRC community well for many years.

If you're looking for a modern IRC client for macOS in 2025, consider:
- **Textual** - Native macOS client with Apple Silicon support
- **Colloquy** - Free and open source
- **WeeChat** - Terminal-based for power users

Thanks to everyone who used these themes over the years!

LimeChat is a decent IRC client for OS X. You can get it at http://limechat.net/mac/

Solarized is a color scheme that can be applied to just about any application. You can read more about it at http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

Installing these color schemes is easy. Just clone the repository and copy the files to `Library/Application Support/LimeChat/Themes` in your home directory.
